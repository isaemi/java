/* Interface
 * Interface is a fully abstract class. It includes a group of abstract methods or methods without body
 * - An interface is declared using interface keyword
 * - All the methods of an interface are abstract
 * - It cannot be instantiated
 * - It cannot contain constuctors
 * - It cannot contain instance field but it can contain static and fianl fields
 * - An interface is not extended but it is implemented by a class
 * - It is used to achieve multiple inheritanceswhich are not possible in normal class
 * When the compiler automatically converts the data members with 'public static final' and methods to 'public abstract'
