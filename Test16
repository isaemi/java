/* Constructor
 * A Constructor is similar to method but it has the same that of the class.
 * It is called when an instance of the class is created or object is created.
 * - A Constructor has the same name with the class
 * - It is called automatically when an object is created using new
 * - One class can have multiple constructors
 * - It is basically used to initialize the members variable
 * - It is optional to use the access modifiers (See the Encapsulation Topic) to access with constructor to control its access
 * - It cannot be abstract, static or final
 * - If we compare the method and constroctor then the following points may be realize:
 * 		- Constructor has the same with the class whereas method name must be different
 * 		- Constructor does not return any values where as a method has to return a value otherwise you need to use void
 * 		- Constructor is called only once during object creation where as a method can be called any number of times
 * There are two types of constructor in java
 * - Default Constructor (no-arg constructor)
 * - Parameterized Constructor
