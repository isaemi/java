import java.util.Vector;

/* Vector
 * - Vector uses a dynamic array (growable array of objects) to store the data elements
 * - It is similar to ArrayList, but it is synchronized
 * - It contains many methods that are not the part of collection framework
 * Note: It is recommended to use the Vector class in the thread-safe implementation only.
 * If you don't need to use thread-safe implementation, you should use the ArrayList, the ArrayList will perform better in such case.
